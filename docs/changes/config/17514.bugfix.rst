With ``astropy`` v7.0.0 the cache directory cannot be customized with the
``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` environment variable.
Instead, ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` erroneously controls both configuration and cache
directories.
The correct pre-v7.0.0 behaviour has been restored, but it is possible that
``astropy`` v7.0.0 has written cache files to surprising locations.
Concerned users can use the ``get_cache_dir_path()`` function to check where
the cache files are written.

The bug in question does not affect systems where the ``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` and
``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` environment variables are unset.

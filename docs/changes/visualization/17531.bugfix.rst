The following private classes from ``astropy.visualization.lupton_rgb``, that
were dropped without deprecation in astropy 7.0.0, were re-introduced following
a report that they were used downstream. The following classes are now
considered public:

- ``Mapping``
- ``AsinhMapping``
- ``LinearMapping``
- ``AsinhZScaleMapping``
